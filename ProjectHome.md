# About Drupal #
Drupal is an open source content management platform. Equipped with a powerful blend of features, Drupal can support a variety of websites, including personal blogs, corporate brochures, and large community-driven websites. It is used to power numerous high-profile websites including [Sony Musicbox](http://musicbox.sonybmg.com/), [PopSugar](http://popsugar.com/), and [MTV UK](http://www.mtv.co.uk/). Many of our Google Summer of Code participants have gone on to full-time jobs at Drupal consulting firms around the globe.
