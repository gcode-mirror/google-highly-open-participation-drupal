= Task Categories =

// TODO: Fill in with final task categories list.

Most tasks have been sorted into the following categories. You can find all tasks in a particular category by searching for a particular label:

    * Code: tasks which involve patching existing code or writing new code
    * Documentation: tasks which involve fixing errors in existing documentation or writing new documentation
    * Marketing: tasks which involve helping the project spread the word about their offerings
    * Localization: tasks which involve translating documentation, etc. into other languages
    * Testing: tasks which involve testing software or writing tests for an existing code base
    * User Interface: tasks which involve UI design or user experience research 

Tasks which do not fall into one of these categories will be labeled "other."

If you are interested in participating in the contest by working on the Drupal project, you should spend some time checking out the project website.  It is also recommended that you get an account on Drupal.org.


Here are some of the first things to check out as a newly arrived contributor:

    * Download: You can get a copy of the latest version of Drupal from this page.
    * Documentation: Start here to get information About Drupal, Installation and read our existing documentation.
    * API Documentation: This site has all of the developer API documentation.
    * Mailing Lists: This page will explain all of the project mailing lists, including what each list is used for and how to subscribe.
    * IRC Channels: There are a number of IRC channels, many for specific areas of Drupal.


= Working with the Community =

    * Working with the issue queue (???)


= HowTos for Specific Tasks =

    * Setting up a test environment: http://drupal.org/node/28245
    * Creating a Drupal theme (???)
    * Creating a video
          o Contributing Videocasts handbook page 
    * How to perform a usability study (???)


= Getting Help =

If you have signed up to complete a particular task and you have some questions about how best to complete it, first see if the task description has specific instructions about whom to contact for assistance. If there are no specific instructions in the task, these resources should be helpful to you:

    * By Chat: Representatives from the Drupal project will be hanging out in #drupal-ghop on irc.freenode.net to answer any questions you may have. If they don't know the answer, they will be happy to point you in the right direction.
    * By Email: Will we have a mailing list? I'm thinking we'll use a groups.drupal.org group rather than a mailing list, since this is normally how this sort of collaboration works in the community. Unfortunately, there is no way to create a truly private group that doesn't appear in the UI everywhere, so we can't do so until after Google's announcement, so that means individual e-mails for now. :( -Webchickenator 11/4/07 11:04 PM

      You can always ask questions on our contest group page, http://groups.drupal.org/ghop. Please let us know where you've looked for the answer so we can note for the future areas where our documentation can be strengthened.

      If you have asked your question on the group but find you need a more granular answer, one of the program administrators will introduce you to the right person. 


= Other Questions =

If you have a question not answered here that is related to contest mechanics, your best bet is to check out Google's program page for more details. You can also contact Google's program administrators for help by emailing them at example at google dot com.
